sql：

left连接
SELECT imgid,price,stocknum,price,`desc` FROM `shop` as u LEFT JOIN `pics` a on u.id = a.id;

内连接
SELECT a.*,b.* FROM shop a JOIN pics b on a.imgid=b.imgid;

具体查询一条数据
SELECT a.*,b.* FROM shop a JOIN pics b on a.imgid=b.imgid WHERE a.id=21;

优化
select  shop.*, pics.url, pics.`from`  from shop, pics WHERE shop.imgid = pics.id AND shop.id = 224;

select  shop.*, pics.url, pics.`from` from shop LEFT JOIN pics on shop.imgid = pics.id;


根据shop表：
1：统计出stocknum这个字段的总和更新到stock表的total
2：根据type=0 type=1 type=2的各字段总和更新到stock表的typecostume,typeelectrical,typedigital

UPDATE stock SET total = (SELECT SUM(stocknum) FROM shop)

UPDATE stock SET typecostume = (SELECT SUM(1) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 0), 
				 typeelectrical = (SELECT SUM(1) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 1), 
				 typedigital = (SELECT SUM(1) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 2);


UPDATE stock SET total = (SELECT SUM(stocknum) FROM shop), 
		typecostume = (SELECT SUM(stocknum) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 0), 
		typeelectrical = (SELECT SUM(stocknum) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 1), 
		typedigital = (SELECT SUM(stocknum) FROM shop s WHERE s.type = 2);
		
		
SELECT `order`.* ,shop.id,shop.imgid, shop.describes, pics.url FROM `order`,shop,pics 
		WHERE `order`.shopid=shop.id 
		AND pics.id=shop.imgid 
		AND `order`.userid=30;
